        <Description>
            A deeply personal short film I wrote, produced, and edited as a solo school project.
            Featuring original music by my band The Future Is, this emotional narrative follows
            a man haunted by grief and regret as he revisits memories of a lost relationship.
            As the story unfolds between past and present, it explores the weight of unspoken words
            and the importance of cherishing the people we love before itâ€™s too late.
