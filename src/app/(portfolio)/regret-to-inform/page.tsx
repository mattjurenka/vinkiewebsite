        <Description>
            A short film I wrote, directed, produced, edited, and scored as a school project.
            Set in the aftermath of personal tragedy, the story centers on a grieving man weighed down
            by loss and unresolved emotions. When a friend visits and encourages him to confront a
            letter that holds painful memories, the film gently reveals the quiet strength of friendship
            in the face of hardship. A reminder that even in our darkest moments, we donâ€™t have to
            face life alone.
